 * @param {string} args.keyID An identifier for the message being encrypted. When decrypting, the same message ID will be required. This can be used to prevent key re-use, even when the same two users are using the same protocol to encrypt multiple messages. It can be randomly-generated, sequential, or even fixed.

 * @param {Uint8Array|string} [args.counterparty=self] If specified, the user with this identity key will also be able to decrypt the message, as long as they specify the current user's identity key as their counterparty. Must be a hexadecimal string representing a 33-byte or 65-byte value, "self" or "anyone".
 * @param {boolean} [args.privileged=false] When true, the data will be encrypted with the user's privileged keyring instead of their primary keyring.
 * @param {string} [args.returnType='Uint8Array'] Specify the data type for the returned ciphertext. Available types are `string` (base64 encoded binary) and `Uint8Array`.
